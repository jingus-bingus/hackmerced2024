*which regressor depends on:
    -relationship between variables Linear vs non-Linear
    -size of data set

*linear regression
    -very simple
    -doesn't require big ass computer to run
    -very interperetable output

    -may be too simple depending on the relationship between independent and dependent variables
    -outliers will fuck it up
    -assumes independent variables are not correlated at all
    -can't determine feature importance but prolly doesn't matter for us

*Ridge/Lasso regression: regularized linear regression
    -like linear but regularization helps prevent overfitting
    -maybe worth cross validating between the two models

*linear support vector regression:
    -also asssumes linear relationships
    -robust to outliers
    -easy to interperet
    -sensitive to hyperparameters, search might take longer
    -more computationally expensive but with smallish data set it might not matter

*polynomial regression
    -can show a more complex relationship


*we start with linear regression, cross validate with ridge and lasso, then use polynomial regression if inaccurate
*for scorer during hyperparameter tuning use mean squared error or mean absolute error
*probably reduce dataset more than I thought
    -random sampling or average out larger amounts of data points, probably average because rain amount is uniform



PLAN: 
    -start with linear regression using averages of each raster map
    -80-20 train/test split
    -perform grid search cross validation
